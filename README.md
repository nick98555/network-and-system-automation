# Network and System Automation

This repository contains two small automation projects developed as part of coursework in Linux and Python system administration. Both projects focus on fundamental automation tasks: one for networking (VLAN management using Python and SSH), and one for system provisioning (user account creation using Ansible).

## Contents

- `python-vlan-automation/` – A Python-based tool to configure and retrieve VLAN data from network devices via SSH
- `ansible-user-creation/` – An Ansible playbook and inventory for creating Linux user accounts

Each subproject includes a README with technical details and example output.
