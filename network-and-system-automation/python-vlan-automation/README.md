# Python VLAN Automation

This project uses Python and SSH to automate VLAN configuration and status checking on network devices.

## Files

- `addVlans.py` – Adds VLANs to the target device
- `showVlan.py` – Retrieves current VLAN configuration from the device

## Notes

This was developed as a learning exercise in remote device scripting using Python. Credentials and device IPs are assumed to be handled securely outside the script.
